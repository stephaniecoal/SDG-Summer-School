# SDG Summer School

**Project Description**

This yearâ€™s Summer School is inspired by the challenge of SCALING EDUCATION FOR THE SDGS. How can young innovators use CROWDSOURCING and OPEN DATA, combined with new technologies and social networks, to maximize the impact of SDG Education?

**Overview**

The SDG Summer School is part of the many programs carried out by the Geneva Tsinghua Initiative. It is all about team-based problem solving and hands-on prototype development, going from a conception phase to producing practical demos. All accepted participants receive intensive mentoring and coaching to help transform their ideas into impactful projects, and become part of a global community of civic innovators. The SDG Summer School also includes study visits to and mini lectures from UN Agencies, International Organisations, NGOs and other partnering organisations in Geneva.

The motivation of the SDG Summer School is for teams of university students, in close collaboration with International Organizations in Geneva, to conceive ways to use open data, crowdsourcing technologies, and low-cost open source solutions to develop prototypes suitable for deployment and tackle sustainable development, and ultimately to achieve concrete steps towards the SDGs, at a local, regional or global level.
